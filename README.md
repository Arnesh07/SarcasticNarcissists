Our idea is to alert people before a disaster as well as to create a post disaster mechanism.
We will do this by predicting the areas and people prone to the disaster and warning them about it.
Taking the example of an earthquake, we will first track the last/current location of the user.
Then we will mark a region centered at the epicenter having a radius which will be calculated using the magnitude of the earthquake.
We will send an override alert message to those people whose last/current tracked location lies inside the marked region.
For the smartphone users with internet access,we will alert them using an application already present on their smartphones.
For users without any kind of internet access,the alert will be initiated using their sim cards.
And for the rest of the people, Television and Radio will act as the key in warning them.
Our Post-Disaster Mechanism aims to make better use of the resources provided by authorities by prioritizing most affected areas.
We will provide a Status System, which will consider each user "In Danger" by default, in which users can update their status as "I'm Safe" as soon as it is possible for them to do so after the disaster.
The places having less number density of "I'm Safe" notifications will be prioritized.
This data can be conveniently collected from all the users and sent to the concerned authorities by using a realtime database.
This is how our app works.
