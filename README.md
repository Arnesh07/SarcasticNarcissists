We plan to make a disaster management application which on recieving disaster warnings,alerts the user through his/her phone and .
To warn the user about a disaster,assuming the prediction of the disaster is known to us,
Taking the example of an earthquake, we will be targetting the people whose last location lies in a region considered to be disaster prone.For an earthquake,the disaster prone regions will be found out using the magnitude of the earthquake.We will use a user's last/current location to consider him for the warning.
